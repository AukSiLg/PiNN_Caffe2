# PiNN
A easy-to-use interface for efficient device compact modeling using neural neworks.

# Install
Install Caffe2 from https://github.com/Oscarlight/caffe2.git. The forked repo contains some new layers created for this project. The instruction about how to install caffe2 is in https://caffe2.ai.

# What can it do?
- DC IV modeling using Pi-NN (Completed)
- AC IV and QV modeling using adjoint neural network (Coming soon)
